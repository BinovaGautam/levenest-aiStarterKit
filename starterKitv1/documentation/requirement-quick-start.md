## From Raw Requirements to Implementation in 30 Minutes

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 24, 2025  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide to analyze requirements and map them to StarterKit components

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Process (30 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Capture Requirement (5 minutes)**

#### **Example Requirement**
```
"As a user, I want to be able to log into the system using my email and password so that I can access my personal dashboard with my account information and recent activities."
```

#### **AI Command for Analysis**
```markdown
"Initialize requirement analysis session - SESSION-REQ-001. Analyze this requirement: 'As a user, I want to be able to log into the system using my email and password so that I can access my personal dashboard with my account information and recent activities.' Break down into components and map to StarterKit structure."
```

### **Step 2: Automated Classification (2 minutes)**

The system will automatically classify this as:
- **Type**: Functional (UI + API + Security)
- **Priority**: High (authentication is critical)
- **Components**: Authentication, User Management, Dashboard
- **Mapping Targets**: Tasks, Knowledge, Testing, Security

### **Step 3: Component Breakdown (8 minutes)**

#### **Functional Components Identified**

# Authentication Architecture Decision

## Requirement: REQ-001 - User Authentication

### Decision
Implement JWT-based authentication with email/password login

### Rationale
- Industry standard approach
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable for future features
- Good security when implemented correctly

### Alternatives Considered
- Session-based authentication
- OAuth-only authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (future enhancement)

### Implementation Details
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Refresh token mechanism
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS required for production
- Secure password requirements
- Token storage in httpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection

## ðŸŽ¯ Tips for Better Requirements

### **Good Requirement Characteristics**
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Testable acceptance criteria
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible
- **Relevant**: Adds business value
- **Time-bound**: Clear delivery expectations

### **Common Issues to Avoid**
- **Vague Language**: "User-friendly", "fast", "secure" without specifics
- **Multiple Requirements**: One requirement doing too many things
- **Missing Context**: No business justification or user story
- **No Acceptance Criteria**: Can't determine when it's complete
- **Technical Implementation**: Specifying how instead of what

### **Enhancement Suggestions**
- **Add User Stories**: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- **Include Examples**: Concrete examples of expected behavior
- **Define Success Metrics**: How will you measure success?
- **Consider Edge Cases**: What happens when things go wrong?
- **Think About Scale**: How will this work with 1000+ users?
