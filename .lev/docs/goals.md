# Vision & Long-Term Goals

Levenest aspires to become the **operating system for autonomous software development**, analogous to what npm did for web packages and Git did for version control.

## 3-Year Horizon

1. **Ecosystem of Agents** – Hundreds of community-authored agents and workflows published under the `lev_modules` registry.
2. **Self-optimising Workflows** – Feedback loops that adjust agent selection based on historical success metrics.
3. **Multi-language Support** – Seamless handling of polyglot repositories (frontend, backend, infra) out of the box.
4. **Deep IDE Integration** – VS Code and JetBrains plugins with contextual suggestions and rule linting.
5. **Zero-Trust Security** – Cryptographically signed packages and sandboxed execution.
