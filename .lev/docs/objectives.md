# Objectives

The following objectives guide Levenest’s ongoing development and act as *non-negotiable* quality gates.

## Primary Goals

1. **Safety by Design** – Automate without compromising repository integrity.
2. **Deterministic Outputs** – Given the same inputs and module versions, Levenest must always produce the same results.
3. **Extensibility** – New agents, workflows, and third-party packages should plug-in without touching core code.
4. **Transparency** – All automated actions are logged and human-readable.
5. **Language Agnostic** – Although the reference implementation uses Node.js & TypeScript, the rules and structure must work for any stack.

## Non-Goals

* A full graphical UI – initial focus is CLI & IDE plugins.
* Autoscaling infrastructure orchestration – left to dedicated DevOps tools.
* Replacing traditional project management – Levenest *augments*, not supplants, existing PM workflows.
