## 🏗️ System Overview

### **Core Philosophy**
The StarterKit v1.0 is built on the principle of **AI-First Design**, where every component is optimized for AI agent interaction and understanding. The system treats documentation as a **relational database** rather than static files.

### **Key Architectural Principles**
1. **Everything Connected**: All entities have relationships and dependencies
2. **Session Persistence**: Complete context preservation across AI interactions
3. **Intelligent Automation**: Pattern-based automation with human oversight
4. **Zero Context Loss**: Seamless recovery from any interruption
5. **Extensible Framework**: Easy expansion and customization

## 🧠 AI Agent Integration

### **Agent Types**
1. **TaskManager**: Specialized in task creation and management
2. **BugHunter**: Focused on bug detection and resolution
3. **KnowledgeKeeper**: Manages knowledge capture and organization
4. **QualityGuardian**: Enforces quality standards and validation
5. **SessionManager**: Handles session persistence and recovery

### **Agent Communication Protocol**
```json
{
  "trigger": "keyword-based or event-based",
  "context": "loaded from master-index.json",
  "capabilities": "defined per agent type",
  "requiredDocuments": "automatically loaded",
  "conversationTypes": "optimized for agent specialization"
}
```

### **Context Loading Strategy**
1. **Always Include**: Critical components (sessions, tasks)
2. **Keyword Triggered**: Based on conversation content
3. **Dependency Chaining**: Follow document relationships
4. **Priority Weighting**: Load by importance (critical > high > medium > low)
