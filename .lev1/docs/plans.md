## Development Plans
- Phase 1: Define folder structure, rules (fundamentals), and bootstrap CLI behavior.
- Phase 2: Scaffold base agents and workflows (e.g., CRUD, codegen, review).
- Phase 3: Enable CLI to add/run/validate agents and workflows.
- Phase 4: Allow publishing of packages to `lev_modules`.
